/*
Tokens
Tokens are the smallest elements (basic building blocks) of a program,
which are meaningful to the compiler. 

The following are the types of tokens: Keywords, Identifiers, Constants, Strings, Operators, Symbols

The compiler breaks a program into the smallest possible units and proceeds to the various stages
of the compilation
------------------------

Indentifiers
Identifiers are names given to different entities such as constants, variables, structures, functions, etc.

Rules for naming identifiers
- An identifier can only have alphanumeric characters (a-z , A-Z , 0-9) (i.e. letters & digits) and underscore( _ ) symbol.
- Identifier names must be unique
- The first character must be an alphabet or underscore.
- You cannot use a keyword as identifiers.
- Only the first thirty-one (31) characters are significant.
- It must not contain white spaces.
- Identifiers are case-sensitive

------------------------

Keywords
- predefined, reserved words in C language and each of which is associated with specific features

A list of 32 reserved keywords in c language is given below:

auto	    double	    int	        struct
break	    else	    long	    switch
case	    enum	    register	typedef
char	    extern	    return      union
const	    float	    short	    unsigned
continue	for	        signed      void
